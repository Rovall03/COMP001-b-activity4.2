        <h1>  Cat behavior  </h1>
        <p class="intro">Cat behavior encompasses the actions and reactions displayed by a cat in response to various stimuli and events. Cat behavior includes body language, elimination habits, aggression, play, communication, hunting, grooming, urine marking, and face rubbing. It varies among individuals, colonies, and breeds.
Communication and sociability can vary greatly among individual cats. In a family with many cats, the interactions can change depending on which individuals are present and how restricted the territory and resources are. One or more individuals may become aggressive: fighting may occur with the attack, resulting in scratches and deep bite wounds.</p>

        <div class="Communication">
            <h2> Communication  </h2>
            <p>   Kittens vocalize early in development. Some examples of different vocalizations are described below.</p>
            <p>Purring - This means that the cat is either content or is self-soothing due to fear. </p>
            <p>Meowing - A frequently used greeting. A mother meows when interacting with her young. Meows can also be used when a cat wishes for attention.</p>
            <p>Hissing or spitting - This indicates an angry or defensive cat.</p>
            <p>Yowling - This means that the cat is in distress or feeling aggressive.</p>
            <p> Chattering - This occurs when hunting or tracking potential prey. This consists of quick chirps made while the mouth vibrates. The gaze is fixed and staring. This behavior may be in response to a surge of adrenaline or may be caused by the anticipation of a pending hunt. </p>

        <div class="ears"> 
            <h2> Ears  </h2>
            <p>  A cat's ears can tell an observer what they are feeling, such as pain, fear, or when they sense danger. At times, one may notice cats tend to have something we call, "airplane ears." This is when their ears are rotated to the sides or angled backward.[7] Cats have acute hearing, so when something scares them, their ears tend to pin to the side or back, and the further they are, the more terrified the cat is. It can be difficult to understand what emotion the cat is portraying with their ears, especially since their ears undergo the same pattern when the cat feels they are in danger/feeling defensive, where their ears pin flat to their heads or turn back. "Airplane" ears do not last that long, only until the moment of danger or fear is over. When cats are in pain or feeling sick, they will hold their ears low, rotated to the side. Cats also show feelings of playfulness and happiness when their ears are pointing forward, straight up. This means the cat is alert and content.   </p>
        </div>
        <div class="kneading">
            <h2>  Kneading </h2>
            <p> Kittens "knead" the breast while suckling, using the forelimbs one at a time in an alternating pattern to push against the mammary glands to stimulate lactation in the mother.

                Cats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. Some cats "nurse," i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. The cat exerts firm downward pressure with its paw, opening its toes to expose its claws, then closes its claws as it lifts its paw. The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to two seconds. The cat may knead while sitting on its owner's lap, which may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws.
                
                Because most of the preferred "domestic traits" are neotenous, or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats.[15] It may also stimulate the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human stretching. Kneading is often a precursor to sleeping. Many cats purr while kneading. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct.[16]   </p>
